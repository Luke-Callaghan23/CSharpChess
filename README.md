# CSharpChess
The most modern iteration of all my Chess proprams.  Written in C#, with some fancy OOP features such as abstraction and inheritance!

I wrote this version of Chess in C# in 2019, mostly as a way to show to myself how much I have improved over the years since I started programming.  I was looking through my old chess implementations that I wrote in Java, starting back in 2017 (you can see these in my OldChess repo), and I wanted to see how much better I could do it using OOP features that I had learned more about since the last time I had done a Chess project.  I think that Chess is a very basic example of how inheritance and abstraction can be used to make a problem both a lot easier to understand, and a lot easier to program.
